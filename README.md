# node-blog

This is a blog that I built to begin learning nodeJS and expressJS.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB

HTML is used with Express to display dynamic content on the page. Partials are used for reusable sections, ie. headers and footers. Views are used for each page.

CSS is used to style the blog. 

Javascript is used to display blogs as they are created on the home page. And to render all other dynamic content. 

MongoDB stores each blog object with a unique identifier.

Node is used to create controllers to render each page and every new blog that is created.

## Optimizations

*Optimizations will be made in the future as my knowledge of Node, Express and MongoDB grows!*

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about MVC design patterns. I split the views up into partials. The Models for the blog objects are clearly defined. Lastly Contollers are used for routing to blogs and different pages in the blog. 

With Express I learned how to render dynamic content from the mongo database. Learning how to properly render pages and route with Node has been fun. Node and Express are powerful tool for creating dynamic sites. I plan to continue learning these technologies and to implement accounts and comments on blog posts in the future.
